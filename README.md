### General Info
This project was used to learn how to fetch an API using Javascript. I used an API from a website that produces jokes. I learned how to deal with the response and turn it into JSON so I can insert it into my elements InnerHTML. I also learned about promises, and async/await functions. I am really excited to create projects using APIs.
